  "readme": "# Crossfilter\n\n**Crossfilter** is a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. Crossfilter supports extremely fast (<30ms) interaction with coordinated views, even with datasets containing a million or more records; we built it to power analytics for Square Register, allowing merchants to slice and dice their payment history fluidly.\n\nSince most interactions only involve a single dimension, and then only small adjustments are made to the filter values, incremental filtering and reducing is significantly faster than starting from scratch. Crossfilter uses sorted indexes (and a few bit-twiddling hacks) to make this possible, dramatically increasing the perforÂ­mance of live histograms and top-K lists. Crossfilter is available under the [Apache License](/square/crossfilter/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\nWant to learn more? [See the wiki.](https://github.com/square/crossfilter/wiki)\n",
